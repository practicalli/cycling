Issues and pull requests are most welcome although it is the maintainers discression as to if they are applicable.  Please detail issues as much as you can.  Pull requests are simpler to work with when they are specific to a page or at most a section.  The smaller the change the quicker it is to review and merge.

Please read the [detailed Practicalli contributing page](https://practical.li/contributing/) before raising an issue or pull request to avoid disappointment.

## Local development

Zensical can be installed locally via vu or pip. Practicalli uses uv for simplicity.  Commands are wrapped in tasks defined within the `Makefile`.

Clone the repository and change into the root of the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/cycling
```

Set up a Python virtual environment in the project and add Zensical package

```shell
make docs-install
```

Build the website and serve locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```shell
make docs
```

---

Specific command if now using make:

Create a virtual python in the root of the project.

```shell
uv venv
```

Activate the Python Virtual Environment.

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Build the website and serve locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```shell
zensical serve
```
