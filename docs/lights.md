# Lights

The majority of bicycle lights are designed to allow the rider to be seen by other road users.  They use LED's making them light and use rechargeable batteries.

Lights with 100-600 lumens are good for roads with street lighting. These kind of lights should last several hours and are relatively light weight.

Lights with 800-1000 lumens will light up the road even when there are no street lights or other illumination.
