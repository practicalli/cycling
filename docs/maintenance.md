# Maintenance

Regular maintenance of the bike and its components ensures a smooth and efficient riding experience, minimises injuries and mechanical issues during rides and saves money over the longer term.

- cleaning
- disk brakes
- rim brakes
- [Chain](#chain)
- gears & derailleur
- bolts
- bearings (local bike shop)

!!! TIP "Add bike components to Strava"
    Make it easy to track usage and wear of chain, rear cassette and brake pads by adding them as components to your bike on Strava.

    In the **Settings** > **My Gear** page, add your bike with a meaningful name and details of make and model (especially useful if you have multiple bikes).  Once the bike has been added, select that bike and start adding components.

    Essential bike components are tyres, chain, rear cassette and disk brakes.  Also consider adding wheels, front chain rings, clip-in peddles, brake and shifter cables and disc brake rotors (where applicable).

    Unfortunately Strava doesnt let you add cycling shoes, which would allow you to track the wear of both shoes and cleates.  However, its easy to visually inspect wear on the cleates once off the bicycle.


## Regular cleaning

Keeping the bike clean minimise wear of the components, especially the chain and rear cassette.  A clean chain set will change gear smoothly and cause less mess when maintaining your bike or fixing a puncture.

A clean bike also weighs less, is more aero and looks nicer (especially when taking a break at a coffee shop).


## Chain

Keep the chain clean and it will last much longer, with less wear on the cassette and front chain rings.

The inner part of the chain is the most important part to clean and lubricate.

!!! TIP "Shimano stamped text should be on the outside of the chain when fitted correctly"


### Chain Length

New chains are sold for the longest chain set, e.g. 50-36 for a road bike.  The chain should be measured and excess links removed to ensure the correct chain length.

When replacing a worn chain, the new chain can be compared to ensure the new chain is the correct length for the gears.

If the chain being replaced was damaged it may not be the right length.  Wrap the new chain around the largest front ring and largest cassette ring, there should be two extra links (4 pins) for the correct chain length.

### Chain wear

The inner rollers are the part of the chain that wears and drives the replacement of the chain.

Once a chain has worn 50% then it should be replaced to avoid damaging the rings of the rear cassette and front ring(s).

Timely changing a chain significantly extends the life of the rear cassette.
