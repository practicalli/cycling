# Maintenance

Regular maintenance

- disk brakes
- rim brakes
- [Chain](#chain)
- gears & derailleur
- bolts
- bearings (local bike shop)


## Chain

Keep the chain clean and it will last much longer, with less wear on the cassette and front chain rings.

The inner part of the chain is the most important part to clean and lubricate.

### Chain Length

New chains are sold for the longest chain set, e.g. 50-36 for a road bike.  The chain should be measured and excess links removed to ensure the correct chain length.

When replacing a worn chain, the new chain can be compared to ensure the new chain is the correct length for the gears.

If the chain being replaced was damaged it may not be the right length.  Wrap the new chain around the largest front ring and largest cassette ring, there should be two extra links (4 pins) for the correct chain length.

### Chain wear

The inner rollers are the part of the chain that wears and drives the replacement of the chain.

Once a chain has worn 50% then it should be replaced to avoid damaging the rings of the rear cassette and front ring(s).

Timely changing a chain significantly extends the life of the rear cassette.
