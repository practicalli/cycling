## Audax Rides

An Audax event is an enjoyable long-distance cycling challenge where participants aim to complete a set distance within a specific time limit, focusing on completion rather than speed. The concept originated from Italian endurance sports.

Rides can vary from 50 km to 600 km (or even longer). Riders can self-organise into groups or head off solo.

[Audax UK](https://www.audax.uk/) is one of the world's largest long-distance cycling clubs. Individual rides are non-competitive, usually with a generous time limit to complete the ride. Audax UK Rides are included in annual championships and specific rides qualify or contribute to for awards.

The rides are not supported, except for optional refreshments at the start or end of the ride.  Riders should be comfortable fixing minor issues with their bike (e.g. punctures).
