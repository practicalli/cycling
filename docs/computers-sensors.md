# Computers and Sensors

A bike computer can provide navigation based on [routes](route-planning.md) and present statistics in real time on your ride, e.g. speed, cadence, hill gradients, distance to go, etc.

Computers work with sensors fitted to the bike and the rider to provide highly accurate feedback and physical information about the rider (e.g. heart rate).

## Practicalli Team Equipment

- Bike computer: Wahoo Roam 3 (previously Garmin 1030)
- Coospo H9Z Rechargeable Hear Rate Monitor & chest strap (makes us look like iron man 🤭)
- Coospo Cadence Sensor
- Coospo  Speed sensor

## Bike computers


Computers with "dual band GPS" provide the most accurate navigation and route tracking.  Although any GPS system should be accurate enough to get you to a destination and home again.

## Heart rate monitor

Chest strap heart rate monitors are considered the most accurate as they are closest to the heart.  They are more invoved to wear as they are worn next to the skin, under all your layers.  As a dedicated monitor, the battery should last a long time (6 months to a year for coin battery).

Rechargeable chest strap monitors are more convenient that a coin battery.

Wrist monitor, fitness trackers and smart watches can also provide accurate information, both on and off the bike.


## Cadence and Speed sensor

Cadence is the measure of peddle strokes per minute. 80-90 revolutions per minute (RPM) is considered optimal use of energy.

On long and steep ascents then a lower cadence is likely, especially when gradient makes you feel like you have run out of gears.

!!! TIP "Average 80-90 Cadence on longer rides"
    Minimise the build up of lactic acid and fatigue by changing gear to maintain a steady cadence between 80-90 RPM.

A cadence monitor is attached to the crank arm, usually the left one and near the peddle to ensure sufficient clearance between the sensor and frame.

A speed sensor is placed on the hub of a wheel (usually front wheel for easy access) and provides accurate speed based on the rotation of the wheel.

A speed sensor is more accurate measure of speed compared to a bike computer alone, as the computer would only rely on GPS data that can be intermittent.

!!! TIP "Two sensors in one unit"
    Coospo and XOSS sensors can act as either Cadence or Speed sensor.

    The XOSS sensor operation is set via the XOSS app. The Coospo switches operation by removing and replacing the battery.
