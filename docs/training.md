# Training

With a good training plan, any ride can be tackled successfully.

Create a rough plan well in advance to avoid rushing your training, which will increase the risk of injury or draining motivation.

With plenty of time to train the plan can start with easy and achievable riding, gradually build up to more challenging rides.


## Aspects of training

- distance (prepping for riding 150 km)
- ascent (climbing very steep and long hills)
- endurance & recovery (especially for multi-day rides)

At the beginning of your training these aspects can be focused on separately, especially if one aspect is not a strength.
Gradually combining more climbs and distances will feel more attainable and keep motivation levels high.


## Identify Strengths

Everyone has aspects of cycling they feel more natural at (long distance, hill climbing, cornering, descents, etc).

Building on existing strengths  supports confidence and increases motivation. Base your initial training on your strengths (and preferred routes).

Gradually start working on other aspects, especially when motivation is high.


## Recovery rides

The recovery ride should be enjoyable, such as a ride to a cafe or favourite route. There should be some effort required but not overly taxing your body. You should be able to have a normal day after the ride without feeling tired.

Sprinkle recovery rides in between more challenging rides to build up endurance.

Recovery rides build up your body's ability to recover during a longer ride and especially after a large ascent.


## Exercise off the bike

**Walking** helps stretch leg muscles and is an effective post ride activity. Effective walking supports basic core strength, posture and breathing

**Yoga** or **Pilates** is excellent for core strength (preventing aches in back, arms, shoulders and legs). 30 minute to 1 hour, 3 times a week will give you lots more energy and confidence whilst riding.

**Deliberate breathing** is taking successive deep breaths and holding them. This provides more oxygen to the body and brain, improving metal state and energy levels.
Build up to breathing in for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds and breathing out for 4 seconds. Repeat for 2 minutes (or however long is comfortable).
Good times to practice this are first thing in the morning, before a ride or anytime energy levels are feeling lower.
Deliberate breathing is also a useful technique for recovery whilst riding, e.g. after a long ascent


## Regular riding
Regular riding supports endurance and helps your body recovery quickly (especially your legs & posterior)

regular cycle commuting cycling
local lap(s) at lunchtime or evening (endurance, recovery)
Time away from work / children for focused training


## Bank holiday block training

In the UK there are several bank holidays where many people are not obligated to work. They give an opportunity to go on a block of training rides and make use of longer weekends.

UK Bank holidays for 2026 include:

- 3 April Good Friday
- 6 April Easter Monday
- 4 May Monday
- 25 May


## Rest week

Take it easy the week before a significant ride or event, to allow your body to top up its energy and flush out lactic acid from your muscles.

- Get lots of sleep and minimise stress.
- Final recovery ride a week before the ride
- Yoga/Pilates/Walking the week of 8 June
- Final bike maintenance check, especially tyres, chain, cassette and bearings
- Final trip plan check & packing


## Training Plan

An example guide to the level of effort  for each month, between January and June.
It is important to understand your current ability (to know if you should do more or less initially) and gradually build up your cycling activities.

> NOTE: regular running or swimming will help with your cardiovascular fitness. Only hours riding a bicycle will prepare your body for a significant ride or event (and still enjoy it).

### January

- 2 recovery rides (assess current fitness, identify any aches and pains)
- 1 ride with small to medium distance and ascents (club route), supporting existing strengths
- regular walk / yoga / pilates 3 times a week
- regular stretching ritual and breathing exercises

### February

- 4 rides with medium distance and ascents (club rides)
  - 3 rides to support existing strengths, 1 ride to build new strengths
- 3 recovery rides
- regular walk / yoga / pilates 3 times a week
- daily stretching ritual and breathing exercises

### March

- regular club rides (3 a month)
