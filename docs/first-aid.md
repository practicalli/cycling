# First Aid

Carry a small first aid kit, especially for long and multi-day rides.

Take a certified first aid course or at least familiarise yourself with basic first aid.  There are several websites, apps and YouTube videos that provide official advice from health organisations.

A mini first-aid bag is strapped to the front frame of my bicycle for easy access.

Essential items include various bandages, micro tape and resuscitation mask.

## Automated External Defibrillator

An AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a portable, life-saving device used during sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) to analyze the heart's rhythm and deliver an electric shock (defibrillation) to reset it, restoring a normal heartbeat.

They are designed for use by the public, providing voice and visual prompts, guiding even untrained users to attach pads to the chest and shock the patient, working alongside CPR to significantly improve survival chances until professional medical help arrives.
