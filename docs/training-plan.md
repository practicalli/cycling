# Training Plan

An example guide to the level of effort  for each month, between January and June.

It is important to understand your current ability, to assess if you should do more or less training initially before gradually building up your cycling activities.

The plan is based on preparing for a 1 day ride, covering 160 km and climbing 2,250 meters (e.g. [Dragon Ride Medio Fondo](https://www.dragonride.co.uk/medio-fondo-157km/))
