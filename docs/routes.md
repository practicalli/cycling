## Route reviews


### Sevenoaks Circular

A relatively quite route with traffic only on Poll Hill and the A21.  A good series of modest climbs and speedy descents.

Starting along the A21 and up though Knockholt to the top of Pol Hill.  A speedy decent down Pol Hill, turning left down to Otford.

Then a quick clime up to Kemsing before dropping down to Seal.

A steady climb up through Gothurst Common and short climb into Ide Hill Village.  Followed by a long, fast decent to Sundridge.

A fairly flat ride before the climb up Poll Hill, with a fast decent back through Knockholt and along the A21.

### Virgo Hill

!!! WARNING "Untested route"

A ride to test climbing skills on Virgo Hill, which peaks at 23.4% although is an average of only 7% 🤣

The rest of the climbing is typical of a club run route, with some challenges but nothing as significant as Virgo Hill.

### Toys Hill both sides and Hogtrough Hill

A short and hilly ride up the North side of Toys Hill. Over to Ide Hill village and down Ide Hill and round to the South Side of Toys Hill.

A big challenge up Toys Hill from the south with a chance to catch your breath on the way down the North side.

Up over the M25 straight on up Hogtrough Hill for the last big ascent of the route.
