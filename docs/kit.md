# Cycling Kit

Well-fitting and appropriate cycling kit makes for a wonderful cycling experience.  Regular cyclists should invest in quality products.

Make the most out of your kit by layering items, so that the same kit can be worn all year around with help from additional layers on colder and wet days.

Many companies now produce environmentally friendly kit, using recycled materials.  These are just at good a quality as kit from virgin materials and are far kinder to the planet we all live on.

??? TIP "Look for End of season sales"
    Quality kit can be bought for less from September onward, when the cycling season comes to an end and companies look to sell that years stock before new designs are released the next year.

    Black Friday and winter holiday sales have become more common.

## Recommended brands

There are numerous brands that sell clothing, from entry level to premium quality kit.  The more you ride the more its worth getting a high level of quality.

### SpatzWear

[SpatzWear](https://www.spatzwear.com/){target=_blank}  produce premium quality kit, designed in detail to give high performance and used by professional cycling teams.  Their kit is tested in the Yorkshire Dales (United Kingdom) and so designed for the most challenging rides.

The products are pricey but when treated with care they will last years and be well worth the investment.

I love the SpatzWear kit I've bought, it feels so good to cycle in and is very aerodynamic.

Base layers are amazing and I have worn the [Race Layer](wear.com/products/spatzwear-race-layer-short-sleeve-black-baselayer-racelayer){target=_blank} for most of the last 5 years, except for the hottest summer rides.  The base layer does an excellent job of wicking away sweat and is very comfortable on all day rides.

On colder days I also wear the [Basez 2](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatzwear-basez-2-black-baselayer-basez2){target=_blank} a long sleeve base layer with high neck line.

The 4-season jersey has the same enjoyable feel as the base layers, with wind protection at the top of the chest and over the shoulders.  It is a very snug fit when putting it on, but once on it feels very comfortable.  The 2 rear pockets can seem fiddly to use at first, but making space in them with a hand make it easier to put items in there.

This winter I have been wearing the [Polar layer](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/polar-layer-base-layer){target=_blank}, a fleece gilet that keeps me toasty on very cold days.  It is breathable and I haven't overheated, even on a steep ascent.

I was a little skeptical about the folding wind-block design of the [Glovez](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-glovz-race-gloves-with-hidden-wind-blocking-layer-glovz){target=_blank}, but after a few rides I am enjoying them.  Riding in 5-10 Celcius weather and windy condition my hands were kept warm, unfolding the wind-block covers as the temperature dropped.  The covers take a bit of getting used to but are easier than wearing 2 pairs of gloves or much thicker gloves.

I am trying out the [ShiftR jersey](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatzwear-shiftr-jersey-blue-or-hi-vis-red-utilitywithspeed){target=_blank} and is similar material to the base layer, with 3 large rear pockets.  A pair of leg warmers and arm warmers are on order, for warmer winter days and cooler spring and autumn rides.

!!! TIP "The kit is designed for performance, so has a close fit"

### Lusso

A company based in Manchester (United Kingdom) where all of the kit is manufactured.

I have ordered the [Perform Carbon 3 bib shorts](https://www.lusso.bike/products/perform-carbon-bib-shorts-plum){target=_blank}, made from recycled materials.  These have excellent reviews on RoadCC and other cycling review sites.
