# Route Planning

Cycle computers are common now and routes can be created and shared easily, via GPX or FIT files.

Common sites for creating and sharing routes include:

- [Ride With GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/) to view, edit & create new routes.
- Kommut
- [Climb Finder](https://climbfinder.com/) to find significant ascents to include in your route planning


!!! TIP "RideWithGPS App useful for viewing routes"
    A subscription to RideWithGPS is required if you wish to save route edits or any other action other than viewing a route.


## Ride With GPS

The [Ride With GPS website](https://ridewithgps.com) can be used to create any number of routes with a free account (TODO: check if there is actually a limit).

Use the "Route Planner" tool on the website to create a route from scratch, or open an existing ride or route for editing.

??? TIP "Editing Complex or circular routes"
    It can be simpler to create a new route rather than edit a route which has parts that traverses the same roads in different directions.
    Open the original route and new route in separate side-by-side browser windows and create the new route from scratch, using the original route as a visual guide.

### From a cycle ride

Sharing a ride captured on a cycle computer or other GPS tracking device is a simple way to capture a route.

It is recommended to edit the route as the GPS may not always line up with the roads 100%.

A simple trick is to add control points at strategic places along the route, e.g. just after turns, then slightly move one of the control points an the route will be redrawn to follow the road exactly.

++ctrl+z++ will undo a change if the route disappears or shrinks unexpectedly (adding more control points should help).
