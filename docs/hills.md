# Hills

Challenging hill climbs that can be incorporated into [route planning](route-planning.md).


## South East England

> NOTE: Most large hills can be found in the "Kent Alps" (which has over 200 named mountains)


### Virgo Hill

A gradual climb that increases to 23.4% near the top.  In the top 10 of

| Difficulty points | Length | Average gradient | Steepest 100m | Total ascent |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 144               | 1.7 km |  7.7%            |  23.4%        |  127 m       |

### Poll Hill

A fairly busy main road, although most of the climb has two lanes for ascending traffic.

The surface is a little rough in places, mainly at the bottom of the climb and just before the last 20% of the climb which is nice and smooth.


### Star Hill

A beautiful decent from the North where some real speed can be achieved.

From the South the climb feels quite draggy but doesnt get too steep.  A nice wide road without being busy (compared to Poll Hill).

The surface of the climb is smooth by Kent road standards.


### Baileys Hill

A deceptively tough challenge as the road never really looks steep until nearing the top.  It is a satisfying climb once reaching the top, which is near the east side of Gracious Lane (for a lumpy route back towards London).

Look to the right for superb view over the Sevenoaks Weald valley.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 1.3km
- Average gradient: 7 per cent
- Steepest gradient: 14 per cent

### Bug Hill

A quiet side road with enough room for cars to overtake in most places.

Turning on to Bug Hill road, there a gentle gradient to start with.  The gradient quickly increases to 7% at the first corner and goes up to 13% for the main part of the climb.  The gradient eases a little as you climb and towards the next corner, where you can push for the top.

Repeating Bug Hill climb only needs 3km to get back to the base. Keep heading towards Warlingham on Leas road. Take a left onto Redvers Road (at the start of a small green) and left again onto Westhall Road. Turn left onto Narrow Lane, continuing down the quite steep Succomb's Hill. Left at the roundabout onto Woldingham road and take the first left onto the base of Bug Hill.

Vital Statistics

- Distance: 0.9km
- Average gradient: 7%
- Steepest gradient: 13%


### Carters Hill aka One Tree Hill

Known as One Tree Hill from the National Trust site nearby, ironically the road is flurished with trees.

The climb rises straight up the hillside and the gradient increases into double figures, followed by a short ‘plateau’ of six per cent which offers a brief respite. The gradient then jumps up to 13 per cent for the rest of the way to the top.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 0.8km
- Average gradient: 11 per cent
- Steepest gradient: 15 per cent


### Ide Hill

The name of this climb is taken from Ide Hill village at the very top.

Resurfaced road in 2025 this is a very nice climbing experience.  It is a 'B' class road (B2042) although there is plenty of room. There is some traffic but its not usually heavy.

The climb is from the South and it is a fairly gradual increase of gradient and then starts to increase.  There is a drop in gradient just before the last 150 meters.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 2.4km
- Average gradient: Five per cent
- Steepest gradient: Ten per cent


### Boxley Hill

A longer ascent in the East of the Kent Alps.

Boxley Hill has two distinct parts that you’ll want to be prepared for. This is a climb which has it all – length and gradient.

The climb starts with a gentle rise which varies between 3% and 6% for the first 2 km. At the switch-back the gradient rises to a maximum of 17 %.

After the switch-back the climb briefly eases then the gradient quickly rises up to 23 % and will require significant effort to reach the top.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 2.7km
- Average gradient: Five per cent
- Steepest gradient: 23 per cent


### Devil’s Kneading Trough (Wye Hill)

Spectacular views of the Romney Marsh and Weald await you at the gop of Devil’s Kneading Trough, even able to see the English Channel in the distance on a clear day.

Coldharbour Road rolls up the Wye National Nature Reserve (designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). The main climb is Wye Hill and rises at an average of four per cent over 2.8km, giving you views of the Trough at the summit.

The Southern approach up Brabourne Hill is 0.8km with an average of 7%.  A left at the crossroads at the top and you arrive at the Trough.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 2.8km
- Average gradient: Four per cent
- Steepest gradient: Ten per cent


### Toys Hill

The climb from the North is a steady challenge, gradually increasing at a relatively managable pace.

The climb from the South is a significantly bigger challenge, with steeper gradient.


### Sundridge Hill

A tough climb even when starting from Pilgrims way, as the gradient quickly gets over 13%.  The gradient soon starts to ease (although it may not feel like it) but is still between 5-10% in places.

Just when you think the hill is over, there is a little bit more to climb :smile:


### Brasted Hill

!!! WARNING "Avoid Brasted Hill"

A narrow single vehicle with road, so not that nice a climb and very challenging if there is traffic comming down the hill.

The hill starts in the small village of Brasted, where it rises gently for the first 1.5km. Once passed the Pilgrims Way the gradient starts to ramp up to 20% for the next 500 meters. The gradient levels for the final 100 meters.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 2.1km
- Average gradient: 5 per cent
- Steepest gradient: 19 per cent

### Westerham Hill

??? WARNING "Avoid Westerham Hill"

Not a climb I would recommend as its quite a busy main road and not much room for cars to overtake. Not a hill you can weave on safely if struggling with the gradient.  You should be very comfortable with traffic overtaking you fairly closely.

The decent can also be concerning, especially if traffic is crossing the main road on Pilgrims Way.


### Star Hill

Star Hill road is North West from the roundabout connecting the B2211 and A224 roads.  It is the size of an A road and the surface is in good condition.

The gradient starts relatively shallow and quickly increases, more so as the road swings to the left. The gradient reaches 11% as the road turns right for the final streatch, with the gradient easing as you approach the top.

The road flattens and then a gentle decent into the East end of Knockholt.

Vital statistics

- Distance: 1.2km
- Elevation gain: 119 meters
- Average gradient: Eight per cent
- Steepest gradient: 11 per cent


### Hogtrough Hill


## Surrey Hills

There are some beautiful hill climbs in the Surrey Hills National Park.  They are spread out so a route around several of these climbs will give you a chance to recover.


### Box Hill

Usually a quiet climb with only the odd vehicle.  You are most likely to meet more cyclists than anything else.

A nice sized road with space for cars to overtake safely (hopefully not on corners).

The climb includes two significant corners, the second being a switch-back which lets you know you are over the half way point.

There is a very nice rest stop with cafe and restroom at what feels like the top (although the Strava top is further on). A little further there is an observation point with a breathtaking view of the valley below (and still not at the Strava climb finish).

After the Strava finish the road comes thorugh a small village and towards the end there is a cycle & coffee shop on the right (set back from the road at the top of a car park with a few other shops).
