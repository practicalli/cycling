# Hils

Challenging hill climbs that can be incorporated into [route planning](route-planning.md).



## South East England

> NOTE: Most large hills can be found in the "Kent Alps" (which has over 200 named mountains)


### Virgo Hill

A gradual climb that increases to 23.4% near the top.  In the top 10 of

| Difficulty points | Length | Average gradient | Steepest 100m | Total ascent |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 144               | 1.7 km |  7.7%            |  23.4%        |  127 m       |

### Poll Hill

A fairly busy main road, although most of the climb has two lanes for ascending traffic.

The surface is a little rough in places, mainly at the bottom of the climb and just before the last 20% of the climb which is nice and smooth.


### Star Hill

A beautiful decent from the North where some real speed can be achieved.

From the South the climb feels quite draggy but doesnt get too steep.  A nice wide road without being busy (compared to Poll Hill).

The surface of the climb is smooth by Kent road standards.


### Baileys Hill

A deceptively tough challenge as the road never really looks steep until nearing the top.

A satisfying climb when reaching the top, which is near the east side of Gracious Lane (for a lumpy route back towards London)


### Toys Hill

The climb from the North is a steady challenge, gradually increasing at a relatively managable pace.

The climb from the South is a significantly bigger challenge, with steeper gradient.


### Sundridge Hill

A tough climb even when starting from Pilgrims way, as the gradient quickly gets over 13%.  The gradient soon starts to ease (although it may not feel like it) but is still between 5-10% in places.

Just when you think the hill is over, there is a little bit more to climb :smile:



??? WARNING "Avoid Westerham Hill"
    Not a climb I would recommend as its quite a busy main road and not much room for cars to overtake. Not a hill you can weave on safely if struggling with the gradient.  You should be very comfortable with traffic overtaking you fairly closely.

    The decent can also be concerning, especially if traffic is crossing the main road on Pilgrims Way.



## Surrey Hills

There are some beautiful hill climbs in the Surrey Hills National Park.  They are spread out so a route around several of these climbs will give you a chance to recover.


### Box Hill

Usually a quiet climb with only the odd vehicle.  You are most likely to meet more cyclists than anything else.

A nice sized road with space for cars to overtake safely (hopefully not on corners).

The climb includes two significant corners, the second being a switch-back which lets you know you are over the half way point.

There is a very nice rest stop with cafe and restroom at what feels like the top (although the Strava top is further on). A little further there is an observation point with a breathtaking view of the valley below (and still not at the Strava climb finish).

After the Strava finish the road comes thorugh a small village and towards the end there is a cycle & coffee shop on the right (set back from the road at the top of a car park with a few other shops).
