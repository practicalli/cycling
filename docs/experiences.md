## Audax: Oasts and Coasts 300

I was running behind in reaching the start and missed all the other riders.  I tried to play catch up, hoping I would meet some people who stopped for a banana break.

Unfortunately I got a little confused at one roundabout and it took 20 minutes for me to figure out the right direction.

By the time I got to Hythe I was resigned to the fact I would not be able to catch up.  I decided to head straight for home (London) but I didnt have a map (or a cycling computer).

Heading in a northerly direction and partly wishing for a train station, I eventually made it to Westerham and from there I knew where I needed to go to get home.

Overall I rode for around 17 hours and covered approximately 420 km.
