# Bicycle Toolbag

Essential tools that should be carried on every ride.

- inner tube
- pump (hand, electric pump)
- ratchet tool kit or Allen keys
- spoke wrench tool
- quick link tool

Extra tools are recommended for [longer rides](#longer-rides).


### My Saddle bag

Under seat mini saddle bag is used to keep inner tubes separated, to avoid damage from other tools.  This also makes the tubes easier to find 😄

- 2 x TPU inner tubes – RiderNow 36G tubes 18C-32C
- 4 x TPU specific patches (came with tubes)
- 1 x RideNow Bicycle Tyre Lever – fancy tyre levers to help fit very stubborn tyres
- 2 x normal tyre lever (as a back up of the fancy ones – maybe superfluous)
- 2 x Disc break piston wedges (keep disk breaks open when the wheel is off)

NOTE: when I still used butyl rubber inner tubes I would only be able to fit one tube (130 grams), 2 tyre levers and a box of patches.


### My Top Bag

1 x Coospo X1 Mini Electric pump with extension pipe (creates a tight seal)
1 x Hand pump (when electric pump runs out of battery)
1 x Rear derailleur hanger, specific to my bicycle frame (highly recommended for long distance riding, multi-day trips)
1 x Mini Allen key ratchet set (removing thru-axels, adjusting handlebars, seat post, saddle, etc.)
1 x Quick links (fix a snapped chain) – ensure the links are the right size for your chain.
1 x Spoke nipple tool (for wobbly wheels, especially if a spoke breaks)

!!! TIP "Combine hand & electric pump when repairing punctures"
    Use a hand pump (or your breath for TPU tubes) to put enough air in the new inner tube to make it round.

    Inflating the tyre to 20 PSI with a hand pump (the easy bit) makes the Electric pump last much longer, especially on longer rides 🙂


## Inner tube

Carry at least one spare inner tube on a ride for an efficient way to repair a puncture.

Butyl rubber inner tubes have been used for decades and are cost effective.  A typical tube weighs around 130 grams.

TPU Inner tubes are considerably lighter, between 19 to 50 grams. TPU tubes with an aluminium valve stem are more durable than a plastic stem.

!!! INFO "Schwalbe Aerothan 28 Road tube available from 2 April 2026"

- 1 x Small box of butyl rubber patches (to support other riders)

!!! TIP "Continental Inner Tubes are very reliable"

!!! TIP "Take an inner tube even when using tubeless tyres"


## Pump

Hand pumps that fit in a top-tube bag or attach securely to the bike are convenient options.

An Electric pump with pressure setting & display are increasing in popularity.  They way a little more than than a typical hand pump, but require very little effort to inflate a tyre to the correct pressure.

!!! TIP "Carry a small hand pump even with an electric pump"
    A hand pump is a reliable backup for an electric pump, should the battery run out (or was not charged recently).


### Ratchet tool kit

Granite Rock N Roll Mini Ratchet Tool Kit is a compact bike multi-tool, weighing 136g. The kit contains a mini Ratchet tool, extension rod, and 9-bit kit.

- 7 Hex bits (2mm/2.5mm/3mm/4mm/5mm/6mm/8mm),
- Star bit (T25),
- Philips bit (PH2)
- two pockets for spare chain Quick Link.

Tool bits are made with premium quality S2 alloy steel for exceptional strength and CNC-cut for precision engagement.

The toolkit cover is made with special abrasion resistance and high strength Cordura fabric. A special loop strap with protective patch at the back of roll is designed to work with Granite Rockband carrier strap.

Easy to carry and can be strapped to your frame with the Granite RockBand.


### Spoke Wrench

A spoke wrench or spoke key is a small wrench or tool used to adjust the tension in the spokes of a tension-spoked wheel. A spoke wrench is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple – not the spoke – that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.


Wheel spokes are held in place on the wheel with a 'nipple'.  Wheel manufacturers do not use a common standard size of nipple, although most road bikes will uses a similar size.

Bicycle nipple tool sizes vary, the most common are 3.23mm (for 14g spokes), 3.45mm (13g), and 3.96mm (e-bike/cargo bike/Shimano systems), with variations like 3.3mm for black brass nipples; you need to measure the nipple's square part (across flats) with calipers to find the precise size, as some nipples have specific diameters for different brands or spoke gauges.

Common Sizes by Gauge/Type

- 14g (2.0mm spoke): Often uses 3.23mm (0.127") or 3.30mm (0.130").
- 13g (2.3mm spoke): Often uses 3.45mm (0.136").
- E-Bikes/Shimano: Can use 3.96mm (0.156").
- Black Brass Nipples: May need a 3.3mm wrench, as standard 3.23mm wrenches fit too tightly.


How to Find Your Size

- Measure: Use digital calipers to measure the flat-to-flat (across flats) dimension of the nipple's square part.
- Check Gauge: The spoke wire gauge (e.g., 14g, 13g) correlates to nipple size, but variations exist.
- Consider Brand: Shimano, DT Swiss, and others have specific sizes.

## Longer Rides

- rear derailleur hanger

### Rear derailleur hanger

The rear derailleur hanger is designed to bend or break during a serious accident, to prevent the frame or derailleur becoming damaged (which would be harder to repair and a lot more expensive).

Although every bicycle has a hanger, there is little standardisation between bike manufacturers and even models of bicycles.

It is highly unlikely that a bike shop will have a spare hanger that fits your bicycle and ordering a new hanger can take a few days or more.

Hangers do not take up much space, so carrying a specific hanger will help you get going again should the original hanger become damaged.


## Computers & Sensors

- 1 x Wahoo Roam 3 (used to have a Garmin Edge 1030 but the lugs snapped off – newer Garmins have replaceable lugs)
- 1 x Coospo H9Z Rechargeable Hear Rate Monitor & chest strap (I find a rechargeable unit much easier than coin battery Garmin HR monitor. Coospo glows under your jersey and easy to use – works well with Garmin and Wahoo)
- 1 x Coospo Cadence Sensor (cheaper replacement for Garmin cadence sensor, works just as well)
- 1 x Garmin Speed sensor (had since 2019 and still works well)


## Miscellaneous

1 x Bone conducting headphones

I use to use the Shockz headphones until they just stopped working (after 6 years). I am now trying out the following

– PARAMITA Dv68 Pro New Night Running Sports Headphones (21 GBP AliExpress)
– Sanag A5X True Bone Conduction Headphones (15 GBP from Tenu)

TIP: I put the headphones on pause before the start of the ride and un-pause when I need some music to help me get up a very big hill.


## Tools to avoid

C02 canisters are very ineffective ways to refill tyres and very bad for the environment.

A C02 canister can rapidly fill an inner tube but this also means it is harder to manage the resulting air pressure in the tyre.

There is a high risk of valve damage, especially with TPU and Latex inner tubes.  As the C02 is released the air becomes very cold, which can weaken a valve.  Using a pump after a C02 canister can cause the valve to snap.
