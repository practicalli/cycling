# Bicycle Toolbag

Carrying essential tools and spares ensures that common bicycle repairs can be completed quickly and easily.

Compact versions of workshop tools are availablw which are smaller and lighter, so more convenient to carry whilst out on a ride.

Recommended tools to carry on every ride include:

- inner tube and patches
- pump (hand and/or electric)
- ratchet tool kit or Allen keys
- spoke wrench tool
- quick link tool

Extra tools are recommended for [longer rides](#longer-rides) and a basic [first aid kit](first-aid.md) is especially useful on group rides.


### My Saddle bag

A mini saddle bag is useful to keep inner tubes separated from other tools to avoid potential damage and makes tubes are easier to find 😄

A bag with pockets is useful to keep smaller items like patches and wedges.

- 2 TPU inner tubes – RiderNow 36G tubes which fit 18C-32C tyres
- 4 TPU specific patches (came with RiderNow tubes)
- 1 RideNow Bicycle Tyre Lever – fancy tyre lever to help fit very stubborn tyres
- 2 Standard tyre lever (as a back up of the fancy ones – maybe superfluous)
- 2 Disc break piston wedges (keep disk brake pads open when the wheel is off)

> Using butyl rubber inner tubes I could only fit one tube (130 grams), 2 tyre levers and a box of patches.


### My Top Bag

I regularly ride long distance routes, so carry a few more tools in the top bar bag.  This helps distribute the weight to the front of the bicycle.

- Coospo X1 Mini Electric pump with extension pipe (creates a tight seal)
- Hand pump (when electric pump runs out of battery)
- Rear derailleur hanger, specific to my bicycle frame (highly recommended for long distance riding, multi-day trips)
- Mini Allen key ratchet set (removing thru-axels, adjusting handlebars, seat post, saddle, etc.)
- Quick links (fix a snapped chain)
- Spoke nipple tool (for wobbly wheels, especially if a spoke breaks)
- Quick Link Pliers & spare split link  (for the size of my chain).


??? TIP "Combine hand & electric pump when repairing punctures"
    Use a hand pump (or your breath for TPU tubes) to put just enough air in the new inner tube to make it round. This makes the inner tube easier to fit inside the tyre and helps avoid pinch flats.

    Inflating the tyre to 20 PSI with a hand pump (the easy bit) makes an Electric pump last much longer, especially important during all day rides and touring (or if you are the only one in the group with an electric pump) 🙂


## Inner tube

Carry at least one spare inner tube on a ride for an efficient way to repair a puncture.

??? TIP "Tube specific patches"
    Include patches specific to the material of your tube (TPU, Latex, Butyl) to avoid carrying several spare inner tubes.

    Most tubes can be patched within a few minutes. Inflate the tube enough to find the hole and apply a patch to repair the inner tube.

Butyl rubber inner tubes have been used for decades and are cost effective.  A typical tube weighs around 130 grams.

TPU Inner tubes are considerably lighter, between 19 to 50 grams. TPU tubes with an aluminium valve stem are more durable than a plastic stem.

!!! INFO "Schwalbe Aerothan 28 Road tube available from 2 April 2026"


!!! TIP "Continental Inner Tubes are very reliable"

!!! TIP "Take an inner tube even when using tubeless tyres"


## Pump

Hand pumps that fit in a top-tube bag or attach securely to the bike are convenient options.

An Electric pump with pressure setting & display are increasing in popularity.  They way a little more than than a typical hand pump, but require very little effort to inflate a tyre to the correct pressure.

-

!!! TIP "Carry a small hand pump even with an electric pump"
    A hand pump is a reliable backup for an electric pump, should the battery run out (or was not charged recently).


### Ratchet tool kit

Granite Rock N Roll Mini Ratchet Tool Kit is a compact bike multi-tool, weighing 136g. The kit contains a mini Ratchet tool, extension rod, and 9-bit kit.

- 7 Hex bits (2mm/2.5mm/3mm/4mm/5mm/6mm/8mm),
- Star bit (T25),
- Philips bit (PH2)
- two pockets for spare chain Quick Link.

Tool bits are made with premium quality S2 alloy steel for exceptional strength and CNC-cut for precision engagement.

The toolkit cover is made with special abrasion resistance and high strength Cordura fabric. A special loop strap with protective patch at the back of roll is designed to work with Granite Rockband carrier strap.

Easy to carry and can be strapped to your frame with the Granite RockBand.


### Spoke Wrench

A spoke wrench or spoke key is a small wrench or tool used to adjust the tension in the spokes of a tension-spoked wheel. A spoke wrench is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple – not the spoke – that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.


Wheel spokes are held in place on the wheel with a 'nipple'.  Wheel manufacturers do not use a common standard size of nipple, although most road bikes will uses a similar size.

Bicycle nipple tool sizes vary, the most common are 3.23mm (for 14g spokes), 3.45mm (13g), and 3.96mm (e-bike/cargo bike/Shimano systems), with variations like 3.3mm for black brass nipples; you need to measure the nipple's square part (across flats) with calipers to find the precise size, as some nipples have specific diameters for different brands or spoke gauges.

Common Sizes by Gauge/Type

- 14g (2.0mm spoke): Often uses 3.23mm (0.127") or 3.30mm (0.130").
- 13g (2.3mm spoke): Often uses 3.45mm (0.136").
- E-Bikes/Shimano: Can use 3.96mm (0.156").
- Black Brass Nipples: May need a 3.3mm wrench, as standard 3.23mm wrenches fit too tightly.


How to Find Your Size

- Measure: Use digital calipers to measure the flat-to-flat (across flats) dimension of the nipple's square part.
- Check Gauge: The spoke wire gauge (e.g., 14g, 13g) correlates to nipple size, but variations exist.
- Consider Brand: Shimano, DT Swiss, and others have specific sizes.

## Longer Rides

- [rear derailleur hanger](#rear-derailleur-hanger)
- chain splitter


### Rear derailleur hanger

The rear derailleur hanger is designed to bend or break during a serious accident, to prevent the frame or derailleur becoming damaged (which would be harder to repair and a lot more expensive).

Although every bicycle has a hanger, there is little standardisation between bike manufacturers and even models of bicycles.

It is highly unlikely that a bike shop will have a spare hanger that fits your bicycle and ordering a new hanger can take a few days or more.

Hangers do not take up much space, so carrying a specific hanger will help you get going again should the original hanger become damaged.


## Miscellaneous

Bone conducting headphones can help with motivation of the toughest part of rides and help keep motivation on long distance rides.

Shockz headphones are the high end brand for bone conducting headphones.  Lower cost alternatives can be found on Amazon, Temu and AliExpress.

– PARAMITA Dv68 Pro New Night Running Sports Headphones (21 GBP AliExpress)
– Sanag A5X True Bone Conduction Headphones (15 GBP from Temu)


!!! TIP "Music when needed most"
    Make the most of of the headphone battery by putting the headphones on pause, only un-pausing when a boost is needed. Select music at starting of a ride to avoid the need to stop during the ride.

    Playing music when approaching the base of an ascent can help with motivation for a significant climb.


!!! INFO "Original AfterShocks headphones lasted over 6 years"
    The original Shockz headphones were called AfterShockz.  My pair were used several times a week and worked flawlessly for over 6 years.


## Tools to avoid

C02 canisters are very ineffective ways to refill tyres and very bad for the environment.  If used incorrectly a C02 canister can cause physical injuries such as freeze burns. Incorrectly fitted canisters can fly off and cause serious injuries.

A C02 canister can rapidly fill an inner tube but this also means it is harder to manage the resulting air pressure in the tyre.

There is a high risk of valve damage, especially with TPU and Latex inner tubes.  As the C02 is released the air becomes very cold, which can weaken a valve.  Using a pump after a C02 canister can cause the valve to snap.
