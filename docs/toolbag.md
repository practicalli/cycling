# Bicycle toolbag

Essential tools that should be carried on every ride.  Extra tools are recommended for [longer rides](#longer-rides).


- inner tube
- pump (hand, electric pump)
- ratchet tool kit or Allen keys
- spoke nipple tool

### Inner tube


!!! TIP "Take an innertube even when using tubeless tyres"


### Ratchet tool kit

Granite Rock N Roll Mini Ratchet Tool Kit is a compact bike multi-tool, weighing 136g. The kit contains a mini Ratchet tool, extension rod, and 9-bit kit.

- 7 Hex bits (2mm/2.5mm/3mm/4mm/5mm/6mm/8mm),
- Star bit (T25),
- Philips bit (PH2)
- two pockets for spare chain Quick Link.

Tool bits are made with premium quality S2 alloy steel for exceptional strength and CNC-cut for precision engagement.

The toolkit cover is made with special abrasion resistance and high strength Cordura fabric. A special loop strap with protective patch at the back of roll is designed to work with Granite Rockband carrier strap.

Easy to carry and can be strapped to your frame with the Granite RockBand.


### Spoke Wrench

A spoke wrench or spoke key is a small wrench or tool used to adjust the tension in the spokes of a tension-spoked wheel. A spoke wrench is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple – not the spoke – that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.


Wheel spokes are held in place on the wheel with a 'nipple'.  Wheel manufacturers do not use a common standard size of nipple, although most road bikes will uses a similar size.

Bicycle nipple tool sizes vary, the most common are 3.23mm (for 14g spokes), 3.45mm (13g), and 3.96mm (e-bike/cargo bike/Shimano systems), with variations like 3.3mm for black brass nipples; you need to measure the nipple's square part (across flats) with calipers to find the precise size, as some nipples have specific diameters for different brands or spoke gauges.

Common Sizes by Gauge/Type

- 14g (2.0mm spoke): Often uses 3.23mm (0.127") or 3.30mm (0.130").
- 13g (2.3mm spoke): Often uses 3.45mm (0.136").
- E-Bikes/Shimano: Can use 3.96mm (0.156").
- Black Brass Nipples: May need a 3.3mm wrench, as standard 3.23mm wrenches fit too tightly.


How to Find Your Size

- Measure: Use digital calipers to measure the flat-to-flat (across flats) dimension of the nipple's square part.
- Check Gauge: The spoke wire gauge (e.g., 14g, 13g) correlates to nipple size, but variations exist.
- Consider Brand: Shimano, DT Swiss, and others have specific sizes.

## Longer Rides

- rear derailleur hanger

### Rear derailleur hanger

The rear derailleur hanger is designed to bend or break during a serious accident, to prevent the frame or derailleur becoming damaged (which would be harder to repair and a lot more expensive).

Although every bicycle has a hanger, there is little standardisation between bike manufacturers and even models of bicycles.

It is highly unlikely that a bike shop will have a spare hanger that fits your bicycle and ordering a new hanger can take a few days or more.

Hangers do not take up much space, so carrying a specific hanger will help you get going again should the original hanger become damaged.


## Tools to avoid

C02 canisters are very ineffective ways to refill tyres and very bad for the environment.

A C02 canister can rapidly fill an inner tube but this also means it is harder to manage the resulting air pressure in the tyre.

There is a high risk of valve damage, especially with TPU and Latex inner tubes.  As the C02 is released the air becomes very cold, which can weaken a valve.  Using a pump after a C02 canister can cause the valve to snap.
